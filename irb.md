You must approve any research experiment with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if it involves human subjects.

This document starts with a short list of links you'll be visiting a lot, then proceeds through the various requirements, prerequisites first.


### Quick links

(Usual caveat about UT renaming URLs at least once a year applies here.)

* Public resources, on the Office of Research Support (ORS) website:
  - Human subjects research: <https://research.utexas.edu/ors/human-subjects/>
  - Guide: <https://research.utexas.edu/ors/human-subjects/irb-application-process-guide/>
  - Forms: <https://research.utexas.edu/ors/human-subjects/irb-forms/>
* Private resources (requires EID):
  - Listing of "IRB Studies with [name] as the PI" <https://utdirect.utexas.edu/vr/list.WBX>
    + For studies you're involved with, but under a different role ("Co-PI", "Other", etc.), the listing at the top with very small non-underlined text will be active links if there are more than 0 studies in that category.
    + For non-empty categories, the table displays summary information, again in a minuscule font size.
    + In the "Details" column there are links to view / modify your application.


### CITI training

The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) administers the compliance exams for UT.

Under the "Human Subjects / IRB training" category, you must select either the "Biomedical Researchers" or "Social/Behavioral Researchers" basic course, and then read all the materials and pass the evaluation before submitting an IRB application.

* Public resources:
  - Instructions for registering: <https://research.utexas.edu/ors/human-subjects/training/instructions-for-registering-for-human-subjects-research-training/>
  - Instructions for completing: <https://research.utexas.edu/ors/human-subjects/training/instructions-for-completing-human-subjects-training-refresher-course/>
* Private pages (requires EID):
  - "Your CITI training history": <https://utdirect.utexas.edu/citi/citi_login.WBX>
  - "Previously Completed Coursework": <https://www.citiprogram.org/members/index.cfm?pageID=181>

CITI's terms of service are pretty severe:

> CITI Program Terms of Service include the following provisions. Please read them carefully.

> No Account Sharing: I will not share my username and password with anyone. I will contact the CITI Program Help Desk if I believe my account has been compromised.

> Do My Own Work: I will complete all required quizzes and any other assessments by myself, using only my own work.

> No Quiz Sharing:  I will not share CITI Program quiz questions or answers on any website, via email, photocopying, or any other means.

> No Cheating:  I will not engage in any activities that would dishonestly improve my results, or improve or hurt the results of other learners.

> My Actions Are Logged:  I understand that CITI Program keeps account activity logs, including computer IP addresses, time spent in each content area, number of quiz attempts and scores. Allegations of inappropriate use will be investigated, and the results reported to my institution.

After completing the material, it takes a day or two for the IRB application site to register/update your new compliance status.

If it takes longer than that, contact Holly at <orsc@uts.cc.utexas.edu>.


### FID form

The Financial Interest Disclosure (FID) form is another (separate) requirement before you can submit your IRB application.

* Public resources:
  - The FID: <https://research.utexas.edu/ors/conflict-of-interest/financial-interest-disclosure-fid-form/>
* Private resources (requires EID):
  - Main entry page: <https://spike.orsc.utexas.edu/fid>
  - Full terms of the policy: <https://spike.orsc.utexas.edu/fid/applicationform/modal/UTACOIHOP71210.html>

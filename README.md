## Development notes

Prerequisites: `gem install jekyll rdiscount`

**Local server**

    jekyll serve --watch

Go to [localhost:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to view.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) listens on `localhost:4000` by default.
Use `--port 6789`, for example, to listen on `localhost:6789`.

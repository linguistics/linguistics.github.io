# Local Information

### Campus

The University of Texas is located just a mile or two north of downtown Austin.
It is bordered on the west side by Guadalupe St., and by I-35 on the east.

### Department

The UT Linguistics department is located in the [Center for Liberal Arts](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=College+of+Liberal+Arts+Building,+Inner+Campus+Dr+Austin,+TX+78712&hl=en&t=m&z=14) building ([CLA](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/cla.html)).

### Travel

The main airport servicing Austin, TX and the surrounding area is the [Austin-Bergstrom International Airport](http://www.austintexas.gov/airport), aka. [AUS](http://content.abia.org:8080/webfids/).

Shuttles and Taxis are available from AUS and the [Route 100 Airport Flyer](http://www.capmetro.org/schedulemap.aspx?f1=100) bus stops on the UT campus at the intersection of 23<sup>rd</sup> St. and Robert Dedman, which is just a short walk from the CLA.

* [Drifter Jack's Hostel](http://drifterjackshostel.com/): $30-40 / night (dorm)

  I (Chris) can't personally report on this hostel, but I have a friend who stayed there and enjoyed it. The location can't be beat; it's very close on UT campus.

  In the past, the managers of the _Deutches Haus_ have opened their doors to temporary UT visitors, but their policies may have changed; get in contact with them via their website to check availability and rates for short-term stays.

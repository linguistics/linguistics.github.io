<p>Welcome! This is a fairly empty site, but if you are here you are probably interested in learning about the ASOL committees. See the link on the left.</p>

<p>There is an old relic of a website, available through the "Archived Site" link of the left. A large portion of the old site either a) replicates Ben Rapstine's job, b) replicates functions of the library's website, or c) includes information about Austin life that is a pain to keep up to date.</p>

<p>The use of a website to document information about <i>ASOL</i> (as opposed to the Linguistics department) has some merit. It is worth discussing what we see this space being used for in the future.</p>

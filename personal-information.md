# Personal Information

UT's websites display a lot of your personal information by default, but often does not make it clear how to update or hide your own personal information.


### Profile

[Graduate students](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/graduate_programs/gradstudents/list.php), [faculty](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/faculty/list.php), and [staff](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/staff/list.php) have profile information accessible through listings on the Linguistics department's website.

1. To change your profile as it appears on those pages, log into the [College of Liberal Arts Database](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/_db/) with your EID and password.
2. From there, navigate to the [Myprofile page](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/_db/myprofile/) to change the fields that are displayed on your page.


### Privacy

By default, personal information like phone number, address, and apartment number are exposed publicly. UT's website [disallows](http://www.utexas.edu/robots.txt) Google and other search tools from indexing the directory search results, but this is only a semblance of privacy, since `robots.txt` is a suggestion, not a restriction.

You can't remove your name, email, or faculty / staff / student status from the listing, but you can remove most of your personal information from [the directory](http://www.utexas.edu/directory/). To do so, start at the following page:

* [utdirect.utexas.edu/registrar/myinfo/sdr_restrict.WBX](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/registrar/myinfo/sdr_restrict.WBX)

Instructions:

1. Selectively restrict directory information items below by checking each box and selecting "Update".
2. Selectively release directory information items below by un-checking each box and selecting "Update".
3. Updates to FERPA Restrictions for a directory information item will automatically update the settings for all services that contain that item.
4. Updates to a specific service (Online Directory, WebSpace) for a directory information item will update the item in that service only.
5. You may restrict an entire service by selecting "Change Service" and checking the "Opt Out of This Service" box. Click "Update" for the changes to take effect. Checking the "Opt Out of All Services" box in the "FERPA Restrictions" column and selecting "Update" will restrict ALL information for ALL services.
6. Un-checking the "Opt Out of this Service" box and updating will reset all directory information items for that service, making them "available". Un-checking the "Opt Out of All Services" box in the "FERPA Restrictions" column and updating will reset ALL items for ALL services.

Or if you simply want to update your address, go to this page:

* [utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/utd/all_my_addresses](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/utd/all_my_addresses/)

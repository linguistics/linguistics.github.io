* Conduct September ASOL meeting
* Divide committees amongst the gang(-of-four-)sters, communicate regularly with pet committees
  - Re-register ASOL with Student Activities (November, April)
* Resources:
  - <a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sa/reregsched.php">Re-registration </a>
  - <a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sa/instrules.php">Institutional Rules</a>
* Suggestions:
  - Spring ASOL meeting for public committee check-in, progress report (Justin)
  - Improve committee membership selection process.
  - TLS/SALSA organizing and institutional memory (Elias)


## GSA Representative

* TODO


## Happy Hour

Happy Hour varies in frequency in proportion to departmental attendance. The goal is at least once a month. This committee is responsible for

* The Happy Hour committee generally consists of two people. They decide on a venue and time (generally Friday at 5pm), sends an email early that week, and a reminder on Friday, and arrive at the venue in time to claim a table or two.


## Holiday Potluck

This Fall semester potluck is held on campus in the department's lounge, on one of end-of-semester "No-class days." It generally lasts about two hours, involves two or three emails, a shared spreadsheet, and a little prep and cleanup time.

* This committee generally consists of two people, but one person could easily handle it.
* The "No-class days" (a.k.a. "dead days") are generally the first Monday and Tuesday following the last day of classes; see the current [long session calendar](http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars) for exact dates.
  - In discussing with Leslie, Tuesday seems a better choice than Monday. Tuesday is less dead than Monday, since it is closer to the final exams period. Having it Tuesday also allows time for a Monday reminder to bring food Tuesday morning.
* Emails: send one email out a full week in advance, and one a day in advance. These emails should be sent to `linguisticsdept@utlists.utexas.edu` and contain the following information:
  - Location (current department lounge: CLA 4.310)
  - Time (usually 12:00pm to 1:30pm)
  - A link to a Google spreadsheet. It should be shared so that "Anyone with the link can edit", and have the following columns:

    <table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Contribution</th>
          <th>Vegetarian?</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
    </table>


## International Dinner

* TODO


## IRB

* Suggestions:
  - IRB information, examples of successful IRB proposals


## Open House

Open House is when the department encourages newly accepted students to visit in a group, usually in late February or **early March**.
<!-- History: 2010-03-04 (Th), 2011-03-03 (Th), 2012-02-28 (Th), 2014-02-27 (Th), 2015-N/A -->

The event starts Thursday and ends Saturday. This committee generally helps organize the items marked (ASOL).

- **Thursday:**
  + Open House happy hour, generally with the department buying dinner, generally pizza. This is a convenient place for current graduate student hosts to collect their prospective graduate student guests. (ASOL)
- **Friday:**
  + Coffee and bagels "Meet and Greet" in the morning, in the department. Pretty much everyone is expected to show up for this, unless they have class. (ASOL)
  + Tours of the different labs.
  + Other special-interest meetings.
  + A colloquium or lecture, if schedules allow.
  + Usual happy hour.
  + Dinner at a faculty member's house. Again, most people show up for this. (ASOL)
- **Saturday:**
  + "Dutch treat" brunch, i.e., you pay for yourself. (ASOL)
  + Hiking, maybe.

* There are two or three people on this committee.
* The committee arranges graduate student hosts for the prospective students. The committee members are not required to host students, but it's definitely easier to host someone yourself than find someone to host them for you. **This is the hardest part.**
* The committee coordinates rides to/from the airport.
* The committee helps out department administration with some of the events:
  - Open House happy hour: the committee mostly corrals visitors and current students into the same area. Department administration makes the reservations and all that.
  - Coffee and bagels: again, administration does the administrative stuff, but the committee drums up interest and is there early and helps clean up if needed.
  - Dinner: the committee should help coordinate rides to/from the venue back to the prospectives' respective housing, but this usually happens naturally at the happy hour anyway. And they help clean up after.
  - Saturday brunch: usually at the Central Market Cafe, requires no reservations. The committee helps out with transportation arrangements as needed.


## SALSA

* TODO


## Spring Potluck

* TODO


## TLS

TLS, the Texas Linguistics Society, is an annual, linguistics-only, graduate student conference.

* There are three or four people on this committee. Maybe even five. Two would be pretty difficult. This is one of the more demanding committees.
* It takes place over two or three days—a weekend—and though the date has varied, lately it's been late October / early November.
* Generally, there are two or three keynotes. One or two these are from UT Austin, as funding allows.
* More information can be found on the [TLS GitHub pages](https://github.com/linguistics/tls)


## Workstations

Before every school year (Fall-Spring semester), the Workstations committee allots workstation / locker space to the graduate students, and updates the department workstation listing accordingly.

* There are two people on this committee, and it is a two-year position (one year active; one year advisory). Each year, the incoming committee member takes on all workstation duties, while the previous workstation committee member advises on policies / procedures where needed.
* More instructions can be found on the [CLA GitHub Readme](https://github.com/linguistics/cla)

## GSA Representative

* TODO


## Happy Hour

Happy Hour varies in frequency in proportion to departmental attendance. The goal is at least once a month. This committee is responsible for

* The Happy Hour committee generally consists of two people. They decide on a venue and time (generally Friday at 5pm), sends an email early that week, and a reminder on Friday, and arrive at the venue in time to claim a table or two.


## Holiday Potluck

This Fall semester potluck is held on campus in the department's lounge, on one of end-of-semester "No-class days." It generally lasts about two hours, involves two or three emails, a shared spreadsheet, and a little prep and cleanup time.

* This committee generally consists of two people, but one person could easily handle it.
* The "No-class days" (a.k.a. "dead days") are generally the first Monday and Tuesday following the last day of classes; see the current [long session calendar](http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars) for exact dates.
  - In discussing with Leslie, Tuesday seems a better choice than Monday. Tuesday is less dead than Monday, since it is closer to the final exams period. Having it Tuesday also allows time for a Monday reminder to bring food Tuesday morning.
* Emails: send one email out a full week in advance, and one a day in advance. These emails should be sent to `linguisticsdept@utlists.utexas.edu` and contain the following information:
  - Location (current department lounge: CLA 4.310)
  - Time (usually 12:00pm to 1:30pm)
  - A link to a Google spreadsheet. It should be shared so that "Anyone with the link can edit", and have the following columns:

    | Name | Contribution | Vegetarian? |
    |:-----|:-------------|:------------|

## Workstations

Before every school year (Fall-Spring semester), the Workstations committee allots workstation / locker space to the graduate students, and updates the department workstation listing accordingly.

* There are two people on this committee, and it is a two-year position (one year active; one year advisory). Each year, the incoming committee member takes on all workstation duties, while the previous workstation committee member advises on policies / procedures where needed.
* More instructions can be found on the [CLA GitHub Readme](https://github.com/linguistics/cla)

The Associated Students of Linguistics (ASOL) is the official organization of the graduate students in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin.

The organization is registered on [HornsLink](https://utexas.collegiatelink.net/organization/associatedstudentsoflinguistics), which makes it an official UT organization. We don't actually do anything with the HornsLink account except maintain a list of the committee chairs. [UFCU](https://www.ufcu.org/) uses HornsLink's list of members to authorize access to ASOL's bank accounts.
<!-- So if you have the same name as someone else at UT, be careful! -->

This page documents the responsibilities of the ASOL committees:

## Digital resources

* Suggestions:
  - Keep pages organized; e.g., maintain wiki-map or index of some sort. (Justin)
  - Create a tutorial to make the wiki experience more accessible to first time users. (Justin)
  - Create a tutorial for creating an academic homepage.
  - Fellowship Binder information
  - Raise awareness of UT Linguistics Wiki
  - Encourage ASOL committees to contribute information about their activites, responsibilities, etc.
  - Maintain accurate, up-to-date wiki pages


## Colloquium

* Maintain the Colloquia page
* Publicize Colloquia and encourage students to attend talks and subsequent Happy Hours.
* Coordinate student meetings with visiting speakers.
* Act as liaison between ASOL and faculty Colloquium Committee:
  - Coordinate annual student nominations for colloquium speakers and present to faculty
  - Attend faculty Colloquium Committee meetings and report developments to ASOL.
* Suggestions:
  - Create Wiki pages to organize student meetings with colloquium speakers, plus any other details


## Courses

At the end of each semester, the administration needs to finalize graduate courses for that semester in the following year.
This committee consists of one person to serve as liaison between the faculty member currently responsible for scheduling, and the graduate students who will be taking the courses.

* The Spring semester course schedule is proposed in mid-to-late April of the preceding year.
* The Fall semester course schedule is proposed in mid-to-late November of the preceding year.

Estimated time commitment is 3-6 hours per semester, over the period of maybe a week.
You basically get a spreadsheet of the courses, send it to the ASOL mailing list, and then work with the scheduling faculty member to resolve any conflicts.


## Dissertation Defense

* Organize the collection of books to be sold to half price books for money to support the dissertation defense fund.
  - Email ASOL to ask for their donation of unwanted books.
  - Organize to take the books to half price books
  - Deposit the money with the Dissertation Defense organizers


## Gang of Four

* Conduct September ASOL meeting
* Divide committees amongst the gang(-of-four-)sters, communicate regularly with pet committees
  - Re-register ASOL with Student Activities (November, April)
* Resources:
  - <a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sa/reregsched.php">Re-registration </a>
  - <a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sa/instrules.php">Institutional Rules</a>
* Suggestions:
  - Spring ASOL meeting for public committee check-in, progress report
  - Improve committee membership selection process.
  - TLS/SALSA organizing and institutional memory


## GSA Representative

The [Graduate Student Assembly](http://www.utexasgsa.org/) (GSA) is one of three organization that represent graduate student needs, along with the [UT Student Senate](http://utsenate.org/) and the [Texas State Employees Union](http://www.cwa-tseu.org/) (TSEU).

This GSA Representative position in turn represents Linguistics graduate student needs to the GSA, as a "Departmental representative." This is usually a one person committee, but a second person can serve as "Departmental alternate representative" if two students want to share participation in the bimonthly GSA meetings.

There is a lot of flexibility in how much time this position will take, depending on how involved you want to get.

See the GSA's [About us](http://www.utexasgsa.org/about-us/) and [Committees](http://www.utexasgsa.org/committees/) pages to find out more about what issues the GSA is currently involved in. As a GSA Representative, you will also be able to push for the creation of new committees to tackle other problems.


## Happy Hour

Happy Hour varies in frequency in proportion to departmental attendance. The goal is at least once a month.

This committee generally consists of two people.
They decide on a venue (within walking distance of campus) and time (generally Friday at 5pm),
  send an email early that week,
  a reminder on Friday,
  and arrive at the venue in time to claim a table or two.

Previous venues include:

* Hole in the Wall (Guadalupe and Dean Keeton)
* The Local (Guadalupe and 27th)
* Crown & Anchor Pub (Speedway and 30th)
* Posse East (San Jacinto and Duval)
* <del>Dog and Duck Pub</del> (iSchool) (this used to be the de facto venue when we were in Calhoun, but it has since closed, and we have moved)
* Dive Bar & Lounge (iSchool)


## Holiday Potluck

This Fall semester potluck is held on campus in the department's lounge, on one of end-of-semester "No-class days." It generally lasts about two hours, involves two or three emails, a shared spreadsheet, and a little prep and cleanup time.

* This committee generally consists of two people, but one person could easily handle it.
* The "No-class days" (a.k.a. "dead days") are generally the first Monday and Tuesday following the last day of classes; see the current [long session calendar](http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars) for exact dates.
  - In discussing with Leslie, Tuesday seems a better choice than Monday. Tuesday is less dead than Monday, since it is closer to the final exams period. Having it Tuesday also allows time for a Monday reminder to bring food Tuesday morning.
* Emails: send one email out a full week in advance, and another email on the day before. These emails should be sent to `linguisticsdept@utlists.utexas.edu` and contain the following information:
  - Location (current department lounge: CLA 4.310)
  - Time (usually 12:00pm to 1:30pm)
  - A link to a Google spreadsheet. It should be shared so that "Anyone with the link can edit", and have the following columns:

    <table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Contribution</th>
          <th>Vegetarian?</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
    </table>


## International Dinner

Similar to the [Spring Potluck](#spring-potluck) and [Holiday Potluck](#holiday-potluck), this is held in the Fall mid-semester — a Friday evening (~7pm) in October or early November — at one of the professors' houses.

It's a potluck, so the usual potluck protocol applies: decide on a location (Scott Myers is a usual suspect), a save-the-date a week or two in advance with shared spreadsheet, another reminder a day or two beforehand, and then some help from the committee cleaning up.

One or two committee members is probably sufficient.


## IRB

* Suggestions:
  - IRB information, examples of successful IRB proposals


## Open House

Open House is when the department encourages newly accepted students to visit in a group, usually in late February or **early March**.
<!-- History: 2010-03-04 (Th), 2011-03-03 (Th), 2012-02-28 (Th), 2014-02-27 (Th), 2015-N/A -->

The event starts Thursday and ends Saturday. This committee generally helps organize the items marked (ASOL).

**Thursday:**

+ Open House happy hour, generally with the department buying dinner, generally pizza. This is a convenient place for current graduate student hosts to collect their prospective graduate student guests. (ASOL)

**Friday:**

+ Coffee and bagels "Meet and Greet" in the morning, in the department. Pretty much everyone is expected to show up for this, unless they have class. (ASOL)
+ Tours of the different labs.
+ Other special-interest meetings.
+ A colloquium or lecture, if schedules allow.
+ Usual happy hour.
+ Dinner at a faculty member's house. Again, most people show up for this. (ASOL)

**Saturday:**

+ "Dutch treat" brunch, i.e., you pay for yourself. (ASOL)
+ Hiking, maybe.

ASOL involvement:

* There are two or three people on this committee.
* The committee arranges graduate student hosts for the prospective students. The committee members are not required to host students, but it's definitely easier to host someone yourself than find someone to host them for you. **This is the hardest part.**
* The committee coordinates rides to/from the airport.
* The committee helps out department administration with some of the events:
  - Open House happy hour: the committee mostly corrals visitors and current students into the same area. Department administration makes the reservations and all that.
  - Coffee and bagels: again, administration does the administrative stuff, but the committee drums up interest and gets there early and helps clean up if needed.
  - Dinner: the committee should help coordinate rides to/from the venue back to the prospectives' respective housing, but this usually happens naturally at the happy hour anyway. And they help clean up after.
  - Saturday brunch: usually at the Central Market Cafe, requires no reservations. The committee helps out with transportation arrangements as needed.


## SALSA

[SALSA](http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/salsa/) (Symposium About Language and Society - Austin) is an important conference for sociolinguists, because there are not many conferences for this area of linguistics.
It was originally a joint production of the Linguistics, Anthropology, and Communication Studies departments, with at least one graduate student representative from each department.
It would be a good idea in the future to reach out to graduate students in the Middle Eastern Studies, French/Italian, and Spanish/Portuguese departments, since many of them do sociolinguistics work as well.

+ The conference runs for two to three days (e.g., Friday–Sunday or Thursday–Saturday) toward the end of the Spring semester (usually April).
+ There are three to four people on the committee. Usually two from Linguistics, one from Communication Studies, one from Anthropology.
+ Three or four keynotes are invited, one or two from within UT Austin.

As an organizer of this conference, you will have the benefit of publishing [the proceedings](http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/salsa/proceedings/index.htm) and getting in a publication (published on the website under a utexas.edu domain). It is also fun to run this conference because the organizers often bring in outside musicians or ensembles (to make it salsa-flavored), and there's the possibility of having salsa dancing outings (at Gloria's, or Dallas nightclub, etc.).

* [SALSA 2013](http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/salsa/symposium/SALSA2013_CFP.htm)


## Spring Potluck

Spring Potluck is a lot like the [Holiday Potluck](#holiday-potluck), but more likely to be outside and involve a grill.

+ *When*: shortly before the end of the semester (end of April, beginning of May), on a Friday or Saturday, in the evening, around 7:00 pm.
+ *Where*: in recent years it has been held at a student's house.
+ *Who*: everyone, of course.
+ *How*: Share a Google spreadsheet a week or two before the date (to give enough time to shift the date if needed), with a contributions reminder at the beginning of the week, and a reminder the day before or the day of.
  - Suggested columns: Name, Food vs. Drink, Appetizer vs. Entrée, Vegetarian?, Vegan?


## TLS

TLS, the Texas Linguistics Society, is an annual, linguistics-only, graduate student conference.
It runs for two (Saturday-Sunday) or three (Friday-Sunday) days.
Though the date varies, lately it's been late October / early November.

* There are three or four people on this committee. Maybe even five. Two would be pretty difficult. This is one of the more demanding committees.
* Generally, there are two or three keynotes. One or two of these are from UT Austin, as funding allows.
* More information can be found on the [TLS GitHub pages](https://github.com/linguistics/tls)


## Workstations

Before every school year (Fall-Spring semester), the Workstations committee allots workstation / locker space to the graduate students, and updates the department workstation listing accordingly.

* There are two people on this committee, and it is a two-year position (one year active; one year advisory). Each year, the incoming committee member takes on all workstation duties, while the previous workstation committee member advises on policies / procedures where needed.
* More instructions can be found on the [CLA GitHub Readme](https://github.com/linguistics/cla)

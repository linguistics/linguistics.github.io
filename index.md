# The [departmental website](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics)

The [University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) [College of Liberal Arts](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/) [Department of Linguistics](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics) lists of people:

* [Faculty](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/faculty/list.php)
* [Students](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/graduate_programs/gradstudents/list.php)
* [Staff](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/staff/list.php)

[Instructions](profile) on updating your profile.

# The [UT Directory](http://www.utexas.edu/directory/)

You can search the directory directly from here, as well:

<form action="http://www.utexas.edu/directory/index.php" method="get">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>UT Directory Query</legend>

    <label>Name: <input name="q" style="width: 200px" /></label>
    <button>Search</button>
  </fieldset>
</form>

By default, personal information like phone number, address, and apartment number are exposed publicly, though the UT site [disallows](http://www.utexas.edu/robots.txt) Google (and other search tools) from indexing the directory search results.

You can't remove your name, email, or faculty / staff / student status from the listing, but here are [instructions to remove most of your personal information](privacy) from this listing.

# The [wiki](https://wikis.utexas.edu/)

UT offers a Confluence Wiki behind a UT EID login wall. Presumably access is shared and global among all UT students, faculty, and staff.

You can access this at [wikis.utexas.edu](https://wikis.utexas.edu/), logging in with your UT EID and standard UT system password.

# Special interest groups in Linguistics

* [UT Computational Linguistics mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ut-compling):
  Notices of computational linguistics talks, sometimes more general machine learning / statistics talks, corpora releases, job openings, and other irregular events appealing to the comp ling community.
    _Frequency_: &lt;1 / month
* [UT Natural Language Learning](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ut-nll) (NLL):
  Meeting every two weeks (during the long semesters) to discuss a preselected paper, often presented by a member of the group. Slides are discouraged unless stolen.
    _Frequency_: 1 / week during the semester
* [UT Computational Linguistics Tea](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/utcl-tea) (CL Tea):
  Meeting every two weeks (alternating, i.e. interlacing, with NLL) to discuss the members' current work, often focusing on one or two members. Feedback-heavy. Slides are discouraged unless the presentation is practice for a conference talk.

* [cola_grants_alert](https://utlists.utexas.edu/sympa/info/cola_grants_alert): Weekly listing of university-wide grants.

**Special interest groups in linguistics:**

* [UT Computational Linguistics mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ut-compling):
  Notices of computational linguistics talks, sometimes more general machine learning / statistics talks, corpora releases, job openings, and other irregular events appealing to the comp ling community.
    _Frequency_: &lt;1 / month
* [UT Natural Language Learning](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ut-nll) (NLL):
  Meeting every two weeks (during the long semesters) to discuss a preselected paper, often presented by a member of the group. Slides are discouraged unless stolen.
    _Frequency_: 1 / week during the semester

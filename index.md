# The [departmental website](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics)

The [University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) [College of Liberal Arts](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/) [Department of Linguistics](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics) lists of people:

* [Faculty](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/faculty/list.php)
* [Students](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/graduate_programs/gradstudents/list.php)
* [Staff](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/staff/list.php)

To change your profile that gets displayed on those pages, go to this page:

* [www.utexas.edu/cola/_db/](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/_db/)

From there, you can navigate to the following page to changes the fields that are displayed on your page:

* [My profile](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/_db/myprofile/)


# The [UT Directory](http://www.utexas.edu/directory/)

You can search the directory directly from here, as well:

<form action="http://www.utexas.edu/directory/index.php" method="get">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>UT Directory Query</legend>

    <label>Name: <input name="q" style="width: 200px" /></label>
    <button>Search</button>
  </fieldset>
</form>

By default, personal information like phone number, address, and apartment number are exposed publically, though the UT site disallows Google (and other search tools) from indexing the directory search results.

### To remove this information from the directory

Go to the following page:

* [utdirect.utexas.edu/registrar/myinfo/sdr_restrict.WBX](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/registrar/myinfo/sdr_restrict.WBX)

Instructions:

* Selectively restrict directory information items below by checking each box and selecting "Update".
* Selectively release directory information items below by un-checking each box and selecting "Update".
* Updates to FERPA Restrictions for a directory information item will automatically update the settings for all services that contain that item.
* Updates to a specific service (Online Directory, WebSpace) for a directory information item will update the item in that service only.
* You may restrict an entire service by selecting "Change Service" and checking the "Opt Out of This Service" box. Click "Update" for the changes to take effect. Checking the "Opt Out of All Services" box in the "FERPA Restrictions" column and selecting "Update" will restrict ALL information for ALL services.
* Un-checking the "Opt Out of this Service" box and updating will reset all directory information items for that service, making them "available". Un-checking the "Opt Out of All Services" box in the "FERPA Restrictions" column and updating will reset ALL items for ALL services.

Or if you simply want to update your address, go to this page:

* [utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/utd/all_my_addresses](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/utd/all_my_addresses/)


# The [wiki](https://wikis.utexas.edu/)

UT offers a Confluence Wiki behind a UT EID login wall. Presumably access is shared and global among all UT students, faculty, and staff.

You can access this at [wikis.utexas.edu](https://wikis.utexas.edu/), logging in with your UT EID and standard UT system password.
